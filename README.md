# keras-model-as-an-API

We will create a deep learning model and expose it as an API that will return the output as an audio.
The model that I used will detect the image wheather it is me or a calculator.


Just follow the steps:
	
	
	1 - Install python version 2.7.0
	2 - Create a virtual environment in the keras-model-as-an-API folder 
	by running the following command : Path\to\python.exe -m venv "name of your environment"
	3 - Activate the environment
	4 - Install all the dependencies from the requirement.txt file 
	by running : pip install -r requirements.txt
	5 - Put your keras model in model folder
	6 - Send your image to /prediction using Postman
